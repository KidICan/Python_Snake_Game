# Python_Snake_Game
This is my first attempt at creating a game on python. 
I was able to complete this project by watching a tutorial on the YouTube Channel [Kite](:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bBgyOkoBQ0)
### Game Functionality
**Arrow keys ^, V, <,>**

**^**:This will move the "snake" upwards

**V**:This will move the "snake" downwards

**<**:This will move the "snake" to the left

**>**:This will move the "snake" to the right

### Gamplay

#### "Food" is places randomly around the board at the bigening of the game. "Snake" is places at the center of the board
The player will move the snake around the board eating as much food as possible. For every pellet of food that is eaten, the snake
grows by 1 unit and the score increaes by 1, then food is placed in another random location. This continues untill the players "head"
touches its body. At this point the game will reset putting the player back in the midle with size 1, and score 0.

### Software needed to run this game:
#### The only software needed for this game is to have python and the pygame utility install.
